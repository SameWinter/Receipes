    <h1>Cake</h1>
    <img src="related files/Images/cake.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height:200px">
    <p>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. 
    In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of 
    preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, 
    meringues, custards, and pies. The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter,
    oil or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional
    ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous 
    substitutions for the primary ingredients.</p>
